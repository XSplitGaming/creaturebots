This creature is a very beautiful flying animal that lives in mountains. It feeds on mushrooms, tree sap, and occasionally, rotten meat. It has a wide smooth face with bulging ivory eyes and horns resting on a long, twisted yellow and red body with two wings. Its skin is yellow and porous.
Its young are called cubs; it glows in the dark, and its venom is harmless, albeit painful.
