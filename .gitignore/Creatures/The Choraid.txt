A huge crawling animal that lives in rivers. It eats jellyfish, coral, and every once in a while, plankton. It has a slender mauve furry face with mandibles and a split tongue on a sickly ivory and tan body with no legs. Its skin is ivory and covered in chitin.
Its venom has been known to kill a vat in a record-breaking time and it emits a pungent gas to deter predators.
